# RGO Startup Modifier Review

This review covers the startup-applied `pp_rgo_bonus_*` location modifiers.
Every raw material keeps an own-good local output bonus, raised from `0.15` to
`0.20`. The side effects were retuned to avoid weak or unsupported hooks and to
make each good read as a distinct local condition.

Removed everywhere:
- `local_trade_center_power`
- `local_ship_build_speed`
- `local_slave_pop_satisfaction`

Global guardrails:
- Mining goods may keep negative population growth, disease resistance, or unrest.
- `local_production_efficiency` is used only where the production logic is strong,
  and always with a downside.
- `local_max_control` is allowed, but no value is larger than `0.05` in magnitude.
- Construction speed and building cost reductions are reserved for direct material
  inputs such as clay, lumber, stone, marble, sand, iron, and saltpeter.

## Food And Staples
