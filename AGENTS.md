# Prosper or Perish Constructor

## Repository Workflow

- Use `uv run ppc --help` as the canonical command index before running project workflows.
- Prefer `uv run ppc test`, `uv run ppc inspect`, `uv run ppc analyze`, and `uv run ppc blueprint ...` over raw `eu5-orchestrator` commands unless debugging the wrapper itself.
- Use parser/evaluator commands for game-data and blueprint questions instead of text-searching generated mod files.
- Treat `uv run ppc sync --yes` as a live deploy action. Do not run it unless the user explicitly asks to mirror into the live Paradox mod folder.
- Machine-local paths and deploy targets belong in ignored `constructor.local.toml`.

## Generated Outputs

- Generated parquet, graph, report, and blueprint outputs are reproducible artifacts.
- Commit reusable config, accepted blueprints, scripts, docs, tests, and repo skills.
- Avoid reverting existing dirty mod or generated files unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Localization

- Localization is player-facing in-game text, not implementation notes or a restatement of user instructions.
- Do not hardcode balance values in localization when a modifier, scripted value, building tooltip, or generated modifier effect can display the current value.
- Explain what the player should understand and where to inspect effects; let modifiers carry exact changing numbers.
- When a linked modifier or concept tooltip already displays food-storage modifier effects, do not restate those values in Europedia prose.
- Use plain text in situation panes and generated static-modifier descriptions unless that target UI is verified to support inline concept links; unsupported formatter tags spam `error.log`.
- Situation map legends should use mod-owned plain localization keys, not inherited or generic `LEGEND_KEY_*` keys, because legend UI is sensitive to formatter syntax.
- In GUI files, do not put `#` formatter markers in `default_format` style names; use the raw style key such as `yellow_titles`.
